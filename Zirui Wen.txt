Education
Stevens Institute of Technology, MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence, GPA 3.94/4.0 Sep 2024 – May 2026
University of Birmingham, BS in Applied Mathematics with Information Computing Science Sep 2020 – June 2024
Jinan University, BS in Information and Computing Science Sep 2020 – June 2024
Experience
Research Assistant — Brain Imaging and Graph Learning Lab, Stevens Institute of Technology Nov 2024 – Present
• Architected a GraphRAG pipeline integrating Neo4j (Cypher) with FAISS dense retrieval via LangChain. On a neurology
FAQ benchmark, EM +32%; with RAGAS faithfulness/answer-relevance (mean±95% CI)
• Designed and implemented a Python data analysis pipeline for large-scale hypothesis testing on 10k+ de-identified
patient records: vectorized ETL and hypothesis testing by Shapiro–Wilk, Chi-square.
• Fine-tuned LLaMA-3 & Mistral-7B with LoRA in the HF stack, exported 8-bit quantized artifacts for inference. Achieved
+20% F1 on de-identified brain-science Q&A.
• Built a custom RL environment and trained PPO for multi-step seizure-trajectory prediction. Delivered +17% higher
cumulative reward vs. clinician-derived baselines.
Data Team Assistant Intern — Siemens Nov 2023 – March 2024
• Built modular Python pipelines (Pandas/NumPy) to automate multi-source data ingestion, cleansing, and
transformation, reducing manual processing time by 60% while boosting data-quality conformance to 99.8%.
• Analyzed 2+ years of transactional data using SQL and Excel to compute KPIs and evaluate A/B tests, providing
insights that informed product strategy and improved engagement by 12%.

Projects
Recommendation service Aug 2025
• Built a Java Spring Boot (WebFlux) microservice for real-time recommendation; integrated Apache Kafka for streaming
and Redis for low-latency features; implemented model loading with XGBoost4J and safe hot reload.
• Containerized and deployed with Docker and Kubernetes using Helm; enabled HPA autoscaling, health probes,
structured JSON logging; exported metrics via Micrometer to Prometheus and visualized in Grafana.
• Implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD with Maven; added unit and integration tests using JUnit 5 and Testcontainers;
built images with Jib and shipped versioned releases to a container registry.
BPlusTree Database Project May 2025
• Designed and implemented a mini-RDBMS in C++, featuring an order-3 B+Tree storage engine, buffer pool,
secondary indexes, and WAL; executed SQL-style point/range queries in O(log n) latency.
• Developed an interactive SQL shell that supports 15 SQL-style commands (SELECT, JOIN, LOAD); built a Python ETL to
bulk-load Google Maps Saved Places CSVs, with reproducible Makefile builds and 90%+ unit-test coverage.
Kernel K-Means GPU Accelerator May 2025
• Refactored kernel-Kmeans to sparse linear algebra, casting core steps as SpMM/SpMV, offloading to cuSPARSE/cuBLAS.
• Tuned for memory throughput and occupancy with coalesced global accesses, shared-memory tiling, and register/SM
balance achieved 1000× CPU and 2.6× dense-GPU baselines on MNIST/CIFAR-10.
Automatic prompt optimization for medical prompts Jan 2024
• Built a text-gradient + momentum prompt optimizer with Bayesian reverse validation; improved MedQA/PubMedQA
accuracy by 20% vs CoT and shipped it as a LangChain service (Flask API + Next.js). Added a pragmatic RAG fallback
using hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense embeddings with RRF) and a cross-encoder reranker to tighten answer relevance.
• Implemented offline RAGAS metrics (faithfulness, context precision/recall) with LangSmith datasets/traces, plus
OpenTelemetry dashboards for latency/QPS/errors; exposed a low-latency gRPC scoring path for critical calls.
