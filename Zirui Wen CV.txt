Jinan University, BS in Information and Computing Science Sept 2020 – June 2024
Experience
Research Assistant, Brain Imaging and Graph Learning Lab, Stevens Institute of technology Nov 2024 – Present
• Designed an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that fuses a Neo4j knowledge graph with

FAISS vector search and LLMs, lifting answer exact-match accuracy by 32% on a neurology FAQ dataset.
• Performed large-scale statistical analyses (Shapiro–Wilk, chi-square, Pearson/Spearman) across 10,000+ patient

records, isolating features that improved seizure-onset prediction AUC from 0.71 to 0.83 in cross-center validation.
• Fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and Mistral-7B with LoRA and 8-bit quantization on de-identified brain science Q&A data,

achieving a 20% F1 improvement
• Prototyped & benchmarked reinforcement learning agents (DQN, PPO) to predict seizure trajectories from time-series

vitals, achieving 17% higher cumulative reward compared to clinician-derived baselines.
Data Team Assistant Intern, Siemens – Guangzhou, China Nov 2023 – March 2024
• Built modular Python pipelines (Pandas/NumPy) to automate multi-source data ingestion, cleansing, and

transformation, reducing manual processing time by 60% while boosting data-quality conformance to 99.8%.
• Analyzed 2+ years of transactional data using SQL and Excel to compute KPIs and evaluate A/B tests, providing

insights that informed product strategy and improved engagement by 12%.

Projects
Automatic prompt optimization for medical prompts Apr 2024
• Designed an algorithm to automatically optimize medical prompts using text-based gradient descent and momentum

with Bayesian reverse validation, boosting LLMs on MedQA & PubMedQA by 20% relative to CoT baseline.
• Packaged the optimizer as a LangChain tool-chain that layers advanced prompt-engineering patterns (dynamic

system/instruction templates, function-calling, RAG fallback) and ships as a production-grade AI micro-service: Flask
REST API, and a Next.js dashboard with live streaming and versioned prompt history.

BPlusTree Database Project May 2025
• Designed and implemented a mini-RDBMS in C++, featuring an order-3 B+Tree storage engine, buffer pool, secondary

indexes, and WAL; executed SQL-style point/range queries in O(log n) latency.
• Developed an interactive SQL shell that supports 15 SQL-style commands (SELECT, JOIN, LOAD); built a Python ETL to

bulk-load Google Maps Saved Places CSVs, with reproducible Makefile builds and 90%+ unit-test coverage.
Kernel K-Means GPU Accelerator May 2025
• Built an open-source GPU kernel K-means accelerator in CUDA, refactoring distance ops into sparse SpMM/SpMV on

cuBLAS and cuSPARSE, achieved 1,000× CPU speed-up and 2.6× dense-CUDA baseline on MNIST/CIFAR-10.
Liar’s Bar: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning Dec 2024
• Modeled the game as an imperfect-information Bayesian game, solved for subgame-perfect Nash equilibria, and used

those policies to warm-start a DQN agent—boosting win-rate 12% over baseline bots in 10k sims. The engine is exposed
as a Flask+PostgreSQL microservice and auto-scaled on Kubernetes for multiplayer sessions.

An Apex Legends AI Aimbot based on YOLO Dec 2023
• Accelerated YOLOv8 with TensorRT+CUDA Graphs to 60 FPS & <10 ms on an RTX 3060 (mAP 0.89 on 1k frames) and

built a lightweight desktop overlay that shows targets and triggers precise in-game aim.
Asset Allocation Optimization Based on PSO and fixed point method Jun 2022
• Reformulated the Markowitz mean-variance problem into an L1-regularised SSMP model and solved it with two

independent optimisers—Particle Swarm Optimization (global search) and a proximal fixed-point gradient method
(local refinement)—boosting five-year back-test returns 2.6× versus the vanilla MV solver.
